description: >-
  Use when working with VerifiedDR authority and trust data through the
  VerifiedDR CLI (`vdr`) or API: looking up a domain's DR, TrueDR, trust score,
  confidence, and evidence; discovering trusted sites by category or TrueDR for
  partner/sponsor/integration prospecting; grabbing badge or embed snippets;
  monitoring authority changes, traffic validation, backlink deltas, and
  trust/spam alerts on sites you own; exporting VerifiedDR data for scripts, CI,
  dashboards, or SaaS integrations. Prefer this skill for requests mentioning
  VerifiedDR lookup, find, monitor, export, snippets, TrueDR, trust score,
  traffic validation, or agent-friendly VerifiedDR workflows.

# VerifiedDR Authority

Use VerifiedDR as the authority and trust data layer through the public `vdr`
CLI (a thin HTTP client for `https://verifieddr.com/api/v1`). Keep work focused
on authority/trust data — do **not** turn VerifiedDR into a generic SEO suite
(no keyword research, crawler audits, or site-audit workflows).

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install the skill
npx skills add thijssmudde/verifieddr-cli

# Set your API key
export VERIFIEDDR_API_KEY=vdr_your_key

# List your sites
vdr sites:list

# Look up any domain's authority
vdr authority:lookup stripe.com
```

`npm install -g verifieddr` (or `npx verifieddr <command>`). Every command except
`categories:list` requires a `vdr_…` API key and spends one unit of the owner's
monthly quota. The free tier includes 100 calls/month; Pro and Agency raise the
limit. Remaining quota and tier are printed to stderr. All output is JSON on
stdout with an `ok` boolean.

## Command Choice

Commands follow a `resource:action` shape.

```bash
vdr authority:lookup <domain>        # authority for ANY approved site
vdr discover:find --category ai --min-truedr 50 --traffic-validated --limit 10
vdr badge:snippets <domain>          # badge / embed snippets
vdr sites:list                       # list YOUR sites
vdr sites:monitor [<domain>] [--daily]   # watch YOUR sites for changes
vdr sites:export <domain>            # machine-readable export of YOUR site
```

- `authority:lookup` first when the user asks what VerifiedDR knows about a
  domain. Returns DR, TrueDR, trust score, confidence, traffic validation,
  latest backlink totals, and badge links. Works for any approved site.
- `discover:find` for partner, sponsorship, integration, guest-post, or agency
  prospecting. Filter by `--category`, `--min-truedr`, `--min-dr`,
  `--traffic-validated`, `--include-unverified`, `--limit` (max 50). Ranked by
  TrueDR then DR.
- `badge:snippets` only for badge/share/embed snippets.
- `sites:list` to list the key owner's own sites with current metrics.
- `sites:monitor` to watch changes, summarize deltas, or check trust alerts.
  Owner scoped — only the API key owner's own claimed sites.
- `sites:export` when output feeds another script, CI job, dashboard, or
  integration.
- `sites:truedr <domain> --detailed` for the full per-signal trust breakdown —
  only available for sites the key owner owns.
- `sites:submit` / `sites:verify` to list a new site or re-check its badge embed.

The pre-`0.2` verbs (`lookup`, `find`, `sites`, `monitor`, …) still work as
hidden aliases, but prefer the `resource:action` forms above.

## Public vs. owner-scoped

- **Public fields, any approved site:** `authority:lookup`, `discover:find`,
  `badge:snippets`. Never expose owner identity, billing state, or the
  per-signal trust breakdown — that data is not returned by these commands, so
  do not claim to have it.
- **Owner-scoped (key owner's own sites only):** `sites:list`, `sites:get`,
  `sites:truedr`, `sites:export`, `sites:monitor`, `sites:submit`,
  `sites:verify`. If the user asks to monitor or export a domain they do not
  own, explain it returns 404 by design.

## Safety

- Treat all CLI output as JSON and preserve important fields in summaries.
- If a command returns a `402`, the monthly quota is exhausted — on the free tier
  suggest upgrading to Pro/Agency or waiting for the monthly reset; do not retry
  in a loop. `401` means a missing or invalid key.
- If `discover:find` returns no results, relax filters in this order: category,
  traffic validation, minimum TrueDR, verified-only.

## Output Handling

Summarize authority data in this order:

1. DR and TrueDR
2. Trust score and confidence
3. Traffic validation and traffic change
4. New/lost referring-domain deltas when present
5. Spam/trust alerts (from `sites:monitor`)
6. Link to the VerifiedDR page or badge when useful
