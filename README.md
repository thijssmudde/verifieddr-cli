# VerifiedDR CLI

A tiny, dependency-free CLI for the [VerifiedDR](https://verifieddr.com) API.
Use it to understand why a domain's **TrueDR** is weak, what to do next, and
whether the work is improving authority over time. The lower-level API commands
still return clean JSON for scripts, CI, dashboards, and AI agents.

It is a thin HTTP client: it talks only to `https://verifieddr.com/api/v1` with
your own API key. It never touches a database or any admin credential.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install the skill
npx skills add VerifiedDR/verifieddr-cli

# Install the CLI
npm install -g verifieddr

# Set your API key
export VERIFIEDDR_API_KEY=vdr_your_key

# Get a score, diagnosis, and next actions
vdr analyze verifieddr.com

# Get the single best next action
vdr next verifieddr.com
```

Get a free key in your VerifiedDR dashboard — **Free** includes 10 calls/day,
**Pro** includes 1,000 calls/month, and **Agency** includes 10,000 calls/month.
Requires Node.js ≥ 18. If global installs are unavailable, run any command
through `npx verifieddr …`.

Every command needs a key and is metered against your plan quota; remaining
quota and your tier are printed to stderr (and returned as
`X-API-Quota-Remaining` / `X-API-Tier` headers). Pass `--key vdr_…` instead of
the env var on any command.

## Commands

The coach commands are the default product surface:

```bash
vdr analyze example.com              # score, main issue, top 3 actions
vdr diagnose example.com             # why TrueDR is lower than DR
vdr actions example.com              # ranked by impact, effort, confidence
vdr opportunities example.com        # directories, partners, backlink ideas
vdr opportunities example.com --contact partner-slug  # send mail to a listed opportunity
vdr audit backlinks example.com      # backlink risk review
vdr content-plan example.com         # authority-supporting page plan
vdr fix example.com --goal +10       # 30/60/90-day growth plan
vdr track example.com                # whether TrueDR is moving
vdr explain example.com              # client/founder-ready explanation
vdr boost example.com                # recommended authority campaign
vdr next example.com                 # single best next action
```

`vdr opportunities` includes potential partnership candidates. Free users see
redacted candidate rows with authority metrics; Pro and Agency users see the
actual site names/domains. It uses the lookup and opportunities APIs, so it can
spend two quota calls when partner candidates are requested.

Pro and Agency users can contact a listed partner without seeing the owner's
email address:

```bash
vdr opportunities example.com --contact partner-slug
vdr opportunities example.com --contact partner-slug --message "Custom outreach copy..."
```

The email is sent through VerifiedDR's partnership mail system, using the same
ownership, opt-out, quota, and confirmation flow as the dashboard UI.

The API commands follow a `resource:action` shape:

```bash
# Public discovery — works for ANY approved site
vdr authority:lookup stripe.com       # DR, TrueDR, trust score, evidence
vdr discover:find --category ai --min-truedr 50 --traffic-validated --limit 10
vdr badge:snippets stripe.com         # badge / embed snippets
vdr categories:list                   # valid category values

# Your own sites (owner-scoped)
vdr sites:list                        # list your sites + metrics
vdr sites:get example.com             # one site with DR/traffic trends
vdr sites:truedr example.com --detailed   # TrueDR + full signal breakdown
vdr sites:export example.com          # machine-readable export
vdr sites:monitor --daily             # watch all your sites for changes
vdr sites:monitor example.com         # watch one site
vdr sites:submit https://example.com --title "Example" --category saas
vdr sites:verify example.com          # re-check the badge embed
```

> The pre-`0.2` verbs (`lookup`, `find`, `sites`, `monitor`, …) still work as
> hidden aliases, so existing scripts keep running.

### What's public vs. private

- **Public fields, any site** (`authority:lookup`, `discover:find`,
  `badge:snippets`): DR, TrueDR, trust score, confidence, traffic validation,
  public backlink totals, badge links. Never owner identity, billing state, or
  the per-signal trust breakdown.
- **Owner-scoped** (`sites:*`): only your own claimed sites.
  `sites:truedr --detailed` returns the full signal breakdown for sites you own.

## Output

Coach commands print plain-English guidance on stdout. API commands print JSON
on stdout with an `ok` boolean; quota and diagnostics go to stderr. Pipe API
commands into `jq`:

```bash
vdr authority:lookup stripe.com | jq '.lookup.authority'
```

## Exit codes

| code | meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| 0 | success |
| 2 | bad usage / missing argument |
| 3 | missing API key |
| 4 | network error |
| 5 | quota exhausted (HTTP 402) |
| 6 | other API error |

## Using it with AI agents

This repo ships an agent **skill** under [`skills/verifieddr-authority`](skills/verifieddr-authority/SKILL.md)
that teaches assistants when and how to call these commands. Install it straight
into your agent with:

```bash
npx skills add VerifiedDR/verifieddr-cli
```

After installing the skill, you can ask for outcomes instead of memorizing
commands:

```text
Run the VerifiedDR growth loop for example.com.
Start by analyzing the current TrueDR gap, then identify the best next action,
find relevant opportunities, and end with the exact command I should run next.
```

```text
Act as my authority coach for example.com.
Use VerifiedDR to diagnose why TrueDR is lower than DR, rank the top fixes by
impact and effort, and turn the result into a 30/60/90-day plan.
```

```text
Review example.com every week with VerifiedDR.
Check whether TrueDR is improving, audit the weakest public backlink evidence,
find the next partnership opportunity, and write a founder-ready progress update.
```

```text
Find one partner opportunity for example.com and draft the outreach.
Use VerifiedDR opportunities, only contact a listed Pro/Agency opportunity if I
approve the target, and keep the email focused on a practical partnership.
```
